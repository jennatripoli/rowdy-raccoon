# Rowdy Raccoon

Skeebo is going feral! Rowdy Raccoon is a third-person game created using Unreal Engine 4. Taking inspiration from Goat Simulator and Untitled Goose Game, the game features a lovable player character, light-hearted gameplay, and imperfect physics. Players can interact with objects and NPCs that operate on a day-night cycle while trying to stay alive and increase their score.
